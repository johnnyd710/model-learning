## Welcome to the Model Learning (Automata Learning) Blog by Johnathan DiMatteo

Imagine yourself as a child examining a coffee machine for the first time.
Your curiousity is grand, you would like to know what it is and how it works.
No need for a manual, you push some buttons and wait as the machine responds.
Quickly you realise the big button on top turns the machine on and the button to the right pours coffee - but wait!
The button on the right does not pour coffee when the machine is off.
It exhibits some *state dependent* behaviour.
Over time, you start to construct a model of the device in your brain: which buttons trigger which responses and under what conditions.
This is what Model Learning achieves; more specifically, about the design of algorithms that perform this task automatically.

> Definition of Model Learning: Given a black box system, construct a state diagram by providing inputs and observing outputs.
